## Overview
This tutorial guides you through the process of creating an advanced text-to-speech (TTS) agent using LangGraph and OpenAI's APIs. The agent can classify input text, process it based on its content type, and generate corresponding speech output.

## Motivation
In the era of AI and natural language processing, there's a growing need for systems that can intelligently process and vocalize text. This project aims to create a versatile TTS agent that goes beyond simple text-to-speech conversion by understanding and adapting to different types of content.

## Key Components
1. **Content Classification**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT models to categorize input text.
2. **Content Processing**: Applies specific processing based on the content type (general, poem, news, or joke).
3. **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Leverages OpenAI's TTS API to generate audio from processed text.
4. **LangGraph Workflow**: Orchestrates the entire process using a state graph.

## Method
The TTS agent operates through the following high-level steps:

1. **Text Input**: The system receives a text input from the user.
2. **Content Classification**: The input is classified into one of four categories: general, poem, news, or joke.
3. **Content-Specific Processing**: Based on the classification, the text undergoes specific processing:
   - General text remains unchanged
   - Poems are rewritten for enhanced poetic quality
   - News is reformatted into a formal news anchor style
   - Jokes are refined for humor
4. **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: The processed text is converted to speech using an appropriate voice for its content type.
5. **Audio Output**: The generated audio is either saved to a file or played directly, depending on user preferences.

The entire workflow is managed by a LangGraph state machine, ensuring smooth transitions between different processing stages and maintaining context throughout the operation.

## Conclusion
This intelligent TTS agent demonstrates the power of combining language models for content understanding with speech synthesis technology. It offers a more nuanced and context-aware approach to text-to-speech conversion, opening up possibilities for more natural and engaging audio content generation across various applications, from content creation to accessibility solutions.

By leveraging the strengths of GPT models for text processing and OpenAI's TTS capabilities, this project showcases how advanced AI technologies can be integrated to create sophisticated, multi-step language processing pipelines.

## Import necessary libraries and set up environment

```python
# Import required libraries
from typing import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from IPython.display import display, Audio, Markdown
from openai import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import io
import tempfile
import re
import os

# Load environment variables and set OpenAI API key
load_dotenv()
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

## Initialize OpenAI client and define state

```python
client = OpenAI()

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    input_text: str
    processed_text: str
    audio_data: bytes
    audio_path: str

## A function to convert text to a valid informative filename

```python

    "news": "Breaking news: Scientists discover a new species of deep-sea creature in the Mariana Trench.",
    "joke": "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!"
}

for content_type, text in examples.items():
    print(f"\nProcessing example for {content_type} content:")
    print(f"Input text: {text}")
    
    # Run the TTS agent and save the file
    result = run_tts_agent_and_play(text, content_type, save_file=True)
    
    print("-" * 50)

print("All examples processed. You can download the audio files using the links above.")
```

```text

Processing example for general content:
Input text: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Detected content type: poem
Processed text: In autumn's breeze, the swift fox leaps,  
Above a slumbering dog it sweeps.  
With grace it dances, swift and free,  
A tale of motion, poetry.
